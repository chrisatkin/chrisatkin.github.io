## Web Development
I'm an experienced web developer with over 5 years of experience designing and developing a wide variety of sites. I have the skills necessary to make your site, no matter how big or small.

- Simple, static websites (like this one)
- Database-driven sites
- Advanced JavaScripts effects

I try to make my designs work in as many browsers as possible including Internet Explorer 7+, Safari 3+, Firefox 4+, Opera and Chrome. I can support IE6 as well if you want, but I charge extra for that due to the [extra work involved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_6#Criticism).


## IT Support
Do you need help with setting up your computer? Maybe it's running too slowly or has been brought down by a virus infection. Want support by someone local to you at competitive prices? Look no further.

- Software installation
- Operating system reinstallation
- Virus/malware removal
- Hardware/software recommendation
- Hardware troubleshooting
- Network installation and troubleshooting

I can support Windows XP onwards (including Windows 8) as well as Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger onwards (incluing OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion).
