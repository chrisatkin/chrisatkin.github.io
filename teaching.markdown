# Teaching
Whilst I was at Keele, I was a teaching assistant/mentor for the following modules:

- [Virtual Worlds](http://www.keele.ac.uk/modcat/2011-2/csc-20024.htm)
- Handling Data
- [System Lifecycles and Design](http://www.keele.ac.uk/modcat/2011-2/csc-20022.htm) (coursework used for teaching materials)
- Multimedia and the Web

I decided _not_ to be a demonstrator/mentor whilst studying for my Masters degree.
