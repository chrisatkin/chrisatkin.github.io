# Living in another country

I'm one of the lucky ones. In my country, the United Kingdom, it's considered excellent if one can find a job after that long three-year slog that is university. If you can get a job that uses your degree - even a minimum wage one - that's even better. The scarcity of these positions has led to the rise of one of the worst aspects of the UK job market - unpaid internships. And yet, here I am, living 5300 miles away in another country for my first post-university job. I'm one of the lucky ones.

I can't deny that the lifestyle here is excellent. For instance, for Presidents Day weekend I managed to go skiing at Kirkwood, wine tasting in Napa, hiking in Muir Woods and sightseeing at the Marin Headlands - home of the famous view of the Golden Gate Bridge. Objectively speaking, I'm having a terrific time here. I'm lucky enough to have a terrific girlfriend who likes to go out and explore the world (and bring me free food from Google). The other SVIPs somewhat regularly get together and do hackathons and what-have-you. There's rarely a night these days when I'm not doing something amazing with incredible people. It seems like everyone I meet has an incredible story to tell. Everyone knows everyone (or so it seems). I'm *supposed* to love it here, because I'm doing what I always dreamed of - working in a super successful Silicon Valley startup after having graduated from one of the top universities in the world. I feel like I've met the lofty goals I set for myself all those years ago in the first lecture of the *Fundamentals of Computing* course.

And yet I can't help but well unfulfilled. I can't quite put my finger on it, but there's just something about living so far away from home that is irking me. It could be the people, the location, the Silicon Valley bubble or any number of other things - I really can't tell.

# Lofty Dreams
I haven't always had lofty dreams - they only really begun when I started at Keele. For years, when I was at Yarm School, I wasn't a particularly good student, not was I being successful. One time, the Director of 6th Form Studies (Dr. Goodall), told me and my parents that if I didn't improve, I would be kicked out of the school. It wasn't unwarranted, I was doing pretty badly - getting the lowest grades possible and retaking a lot of courses. I clearly the remember the humiliation, the indignation of being told that. I *knew* I wasn't dumb. I *knew* that things would get better and one day I would be at the top of the class. That time just wasn't in 6th Form.
