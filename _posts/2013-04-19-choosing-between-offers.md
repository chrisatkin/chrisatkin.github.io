# Choosing between offers

About two weeks ago (okay, well on Monday 8th) I was lucky enough to get the following email from Patti, the SVIP program manager:

> Hi Chris, I'm excited to let you know that you've been selected as a 'top pick' in offers round for: **Guidespark and Thanx**
> 
> Please take the next 24 hours to decide which company you'd like to move forward with and feel free to reach out to either team with any final questions. After you've made your selection, you will receive a formal offer letter later this week.

*Oh God*. Now I have to choose between them. Still, this is quite a nice decision to have! I love both companies and I'd love to work for both of them. *Unfortunately*, I can't choose both so one of them will have to be disappointed. Long story short, I chose **GuideSpark**. It was an extremely difficult decision though, and I hope that Thanx would still consider me for a position after my first year if I want to move from GuideSpark.

Choosing between job offers is always difficult, but especially so at SVIP. The thing is that **it actually didn't matter all that much which one I chose**. *All* the companies are excellent, and I knew I was going to have an awesome time at any of them. Still - I had to choose one. Besides, all the startups are more similar than they are dissimilar (kind of like Oxbridge colleges).

# Practical Details

My first thought was the practical details - where are the companies located, how big are they, what are their working hours, things like that.

## Location and Commuting

Both companies are moving offices before I arrive, but they're moving to roughly the same area they're in now - Thanx in San Francisco itself and GuideSpark in Palo Alto, which is roughly a 45 minute commute (Bob, GuideSpark CTO says people commute in from SF every day), depending on where in San Francisco you are (on the Caltrain I think). If I went to Thanx, it'd be an easier commute than GuideSpark, but it probably wouldn't be much different in terms of time. Caltrain is quite fast, whereas busses are quite slow - not to mention the inevitable morning traffic in SF. As weird as it sounds, I actually quite like the sound of commuting to Palo Alto every day. From my time in Edinburgh and Keele, I liked having a definite distinction between "home" and "work" - adding in that extra commute would definitely allow me to have that distinction between work and home. I see San Francisco as my (cough) playground and Palo Alto as my workground (you know what I mean!).

Plus, GuideSpark is in *Palo Alto*. *Silicon Valley*. The history, the atmosphere...Xerox PARC. Stanford. The list goes on. I can't get an offer from a company *in* Silicon Valley proper and turn it down! This is the *Silicon Valley* Internship Programme after-all.

Advantage, GuideSpark (1-0).

## Company Size

GuideSpark has around 40 to 50 people, which sounds like a lot for a startup. What that *doesn't* tell you though is what the majority of those people do. It turns out that most of them are on the content production side of things, which is fair enough. The 'core business' people are roughly 10 to 15 or so people (execs, devs, people like that). The development team size is about 7 (including one remote worker). Thanx is about 10 people or so in total.

So it turns out that both companies are roughly the same size (the dev team anyway). Tie here (1-0).

## Post-Internship Visa

To legally work in the US without applying for citizenship, you need what's called a H1B visa, and for that you need a sponsoring company (and I think they need to pay some fees as well?). I have no idea if I'll want to stay in The Valley after I finish my internship, but I definitely want the option to do so. Luckily, both companies would be willing to sponsor my H1B after the year, so it's another tie here (1-0).

# The Companies

Sure, we'll 'only' be there for a year (at least), but it's still very important to love where you work. In SVIP, this is probably the single most important factor when choosing between companies. First up, the basics.

## Company Stats

Thanx has been around for about a year, whereas GuideSpark has been around for about five years but until 2011 they hadn't really done *that* much - it was more thinking about their product and stuff like that.

Still though, although I'm sure SVIP wouldn't let us work in companies that are in a state that they could fail within a year, I didn't feel like there was any evidence that Thanx would be around in a years time. I'm sure they will, but compared to a company that's been around since 2008 (or 2011, either way the point is the same) it was pretty obvious which one is more entrenched. GuideSpark already has some major customers (Adobe is one of them), and Thanx has only got a couple of places interested.

## Growth

I can't give out many details (corporate espionage and all that I guess), but there is good evidence that GuideSpark is and will experience significant growth over the next couple of year. I don't know if Thanx has anything similar to this, but it wasn't even made clear to me if they did.

# The Work

Although I thought it was for a while, I (eventually) realised that this is *not* about the difference between joining a relatively large company versus a very small company and helping them grow the company. Both companies are actually working on *fairly* similar things (or at least, will be).

When applying for jobs in the IT industry, one must remember that although a product may seem quite dull, uninteresting or whatever on the surface, underneath it may actually be rather difficult. Take a basic web application for instance - sure, anyone can create a simple CRUD app in PHP (with a MySQL backend of course!). This is much different from writing a scalable app though. That requires caching, CDNs, proxies and all other sorts of computer magic that is just outside the scope of most web apps. One must always 'look under the hood' to find out what's *really* going on, to *really* see what challenges and problems there are. In most cases (except for the most basic of CRUD apps anyway), there's probably *something* interesting going on in there - you just need to look hard enough.

I guess what I'm trying to get across is that although some companies look quite boring, in reality this is probably not the case.

Take GuideSpark for instance. On the surface they talk about benefits communication, health care reform and frankly, lots of boring stuff. If I'm honest, I *kiiinda* disregarded GuideSpark initially as 'too boring'. Sure, this may have been a bit immature but when you're talking to perhaps ten or eleven companies it's really easy to be dismissive about companies. That's just a fact.

This is where the part about 'looking under the hood' comes in. What GuideSpark does is actually quite difficult, especially given both the number of users they have and are projecting to have but also because of the importance of the content. This isn't just videos of cats playing pianos or something else to waste people's time. It affects peoples decisions on a day-to-day basis. It's about their healthcare. Their pension. Stuff that's *actually* quite important.

What [Thanx][1] is doing is somewhat different. It's a new way of looking at loyalty systems. What they've done technically is built a native iOS app (that's really slow on my phone!), a web app for Android in some kind of weird HTA-style app and a basic admin interface. What they're moving into next is analysis of the data they (could) collect. I hate the term 'Big Data', but this is basically 'Big Data'.

The folks at Thanx are truly all-rounders - everyone has done a bit of everything. I got the impression that I wouldn't be as focussed on any particular at Thanx. This isn't necessarily a bad thing - but right now, I want to focus on only a couple of technologies. I've spent 4 years being an all-rounder (through university) and I felt that it would be nice to spend some time really getting to know a technology. One of my goals right now is to become a world-class expert in something and I think at GuideSpark it would have been easier to achieve that. GuideSpark has built their stack on [Rails][2] and [Backbone][3] so it looks like that's what I'm going to be doing a lot of!

Another win for GuideSpark here.

## Style of Work

This is perhaps a little more subtle than the previous section. I'm going to be spending a year at a company - not exactly a massive amount of time but one still wants to ensure that they'll *enjoy* the year. Since both of them are startups they're actually somewhat similar:

*   Standard 9-5 hours with additional time if required ad-hoc
*   Informal attire: jeans, t-shirt
*   Agile: scrums, continuous integration, code reviews, stuff like that
*   GitHub

Having said that, I daresay any company in SVIP has a similar work style. In both companies the standard 9-5 applies, but being startups additional time may be required on an ad-hoc basis.

## "Mentoring"

This section has a bad title but I couldn't think of anything else. One of the things that I need to work on right now is self confidence. That means having a strong (or relatively strong) 'support network' (for lack of a better work) of full-time engineers who I can rely on for advice and things like that. It was made very obvious to me that Thanx, I wouldn't have that. I'd be on my own, battling the evil forces of Hadoop *et al*. That's a nice challenge to have - but not yet. I need time to mature, and I felt that the people at GuideSpark would left me do that.

# Wrapping up

Basically, at the end of the day, you just have to make a choice. The great thing about SVIP is that **there is no bad choice** - *every* company is awesome and you'll have a great time at any one of them. So relax and just *pick one*.
