# Celestia

![Celestia](assets/celestia.gif)

Celestia is a networked, multiplayer space shooter written in Processing. The idea is simple - destroy your opponents, before they destroy you.

Celestia was originally written as part of my university degree; it was my coursework assignment for the introductory [multimedia module](http://www.keele.ac.uk/modcat/2011-2/csc-10026.htm).

The source code and binaries are available [at GitHub](https://github.com/chrispyslice/celestia). [Documentation](http://chrisatk.in/univ/cam/celestia/Documentation.pdf) is also available.
