# _Nova_ Framework Series

![Nova Framework Series](assets/nova-logo.png)

Nova is a series of web development frameworks written in PHP. They utilise the model-view-controller development paradigm.

## [Release 1](https://github.com/chrispyslice/nova)

As part of my university course, I was tasked with producing a small database-driven application for a furniture company. However, there were no mentions of following "best practices" (so it didn't matter how the application was designed, so long as it worked). With that in mind, I wrote a small MVC framework in PHP so that I could separate out the different layers of the application.

## [Release 2](https://github.com/chrispyslice/n2)

After reading about continuation-passing style in an article by Matt Might, I wanted to see if I could apply it in some project (I'm a big believer in learning by doing) beyond . At the time, I had just finished working on Nova and so my mind was "focused" on web frameworks.
