# MooTools-Utils

![MooTools](assets/mootools.png)

Part of my degree involved taking a [module in web development](http://www.keele.ac.uk/modcat/2010-1/csc-20021.htm), and the assignment called for various JavaScript effects, including:

- AJAX authentication and advertisements
- "Web 2.0 API example" (Twitter, in this case)
- Password strength meter
- Effect buttons (change font, etc)

I developed all of these using MooTools, and I'm releasing the source code at [GitHub](https://github.com/chrispyslice/mootools-utils).
