# TARP Dataset
The [Troubled Asset Relief Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubled_Asset_Relief_Program) was a program of the United States Government to provide emergency support to financial instutions during the 2008 crisis. In this dataset, a mostly complete semantic representation of the TARP transactions is presented, along with a vocabulary for describing them.

## Format
The dataset is made available in Turtle format. Note that some preprocessing may be required before the dataset can be used - the endpoints no longer exist. I'm not hosting the dataset (yet), but I am releasing it.
