# Research

## [Auto-Threading Compilers](research-and-teaching/locomotion.html)
My [MSc dissertation](research-and-teaching/locomotion.html) investigated run-time profiling of Java Virtual Machine programs. I worked with [Christophe Dubach](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdubach) and [Bjoern Franke](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bfranke) in order to perform memory operation profiling in order to detect parallelism using the Graal compiler infrastructure.

## [Gait Analysis](research-and-teaching/gait-analysis.html)
I interned for three months as part of an interdisciplinary collaboration between the [Institute for Science and Technology in Medicine](http://www.keele.ac.uk/istm/), the [School of Computing and Mathematics](http://keele.ac.uk/scm) and the [School of Health and Rehabilitation](http://www.keele.ac.uk/healthandrehabilitation/). The project was funded by EPSRC and I worked on [low-cost approaches to gait analysis](pub/approaches.pdf).

## [Medical Image Analysis](research-and-teaching/apex.html)
My undergraduate dissertation investigated the use of fractal image analysis techniques within the domain of medical image analysis. The work continued on from several years of research already conducted by my supervisors, [KP Lam](http://www.keele.ac.uk/scm/staff/academic/drkplam/) and [Dave Collins](http://www.keele.ac.uk/scm/staff/academic/davidcollins/) and was a collaboration with the University Hospital of North Staffordshire. The work is forming part of several upcoming publications.
