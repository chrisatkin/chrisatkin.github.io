## Technical

I'm comfortable working at all levels of the stack from web development right down into compilers. I have excellent working and theoretical knowledge of all aspects of web development including databases, security and scalability. In the past I've also worked on optimizing compilers and almost everything in-between. I find that with a strong computer science background, most new tools and technologies can be picked up quickly.

## Software

LaTeX and XeLaTeX, LibreOffice, Microsoft Office, Eclipse, Netbeans, IntelliJ, Visual Studio, Photoshop etc. Excellent theoretical and working knowledge of Unix-like systems (OS X 10.4 and RHEL-based Linux distros especially) and NT-based systems (NT 5.1 onwards).

## Other

Excellent understanding of software development processes including Agile (see *Experience* section) and organizational skills. Self-motivated and curious with strong debugging and problem-solving skills.

# Projects

# Research

## [Auto-Threading Compilers](research-and-teaching/locomotion.html)
My [MSc dissertation](research-and-teaching/locomotion.html) investigated run-time profiling of Java Virtual Machine programs. I worked with [Christophe Dubach](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdubach) and [Bjoern Franke](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bfranke) in order to perform memory operation profiling in order to detect parallelism using the Graal compiler infrastructure.

## [Gait Analysis](research-and-teaching/gait-analysis.html)
I worked for three months as part of an interdisciplinary collaboration between the [Institute for Science and Technology in Medicine](http://www.keele.ac.uk/istm/), the [School of Computing and Mathematics](http://keele.ac.uk/scm) and the [School of Health and Rehabilitation](http://www.keele.ac.uk/healthandrehabilitation/). The project was funded by EPSRC and I worked on [low-cost approaches to gait analysis](pub/approaches.pdf).

## [Medical Image Analysis](research-and-teaching/apex.html)
My undergraduate dissertation investigated the use of fractal image analysis techniques within the domain of medical image analysis. The work continued on from several years of research already conducted by my supervisors, [KP Lam](http://www.keele.ac.uk/scm/staff/academic/drkplam/) and [Dave Collins](http://www.keele.ac.uk/scm/staff/academic/davidcollins/) and was a collaboration with the University Hospital of North Staffordshire. The work is forming part of several upcoming publications.
