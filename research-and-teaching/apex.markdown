APEX/F was an experimental radiotherapy treatment planning platform designed to aid oncologists in identifying segments of CT scans. It uses sophisticated image analysis (using fractal mathematics and watershed image processing) in order to do this.

APEX/F underwent trials at the [University Hospital of North Staffordshire](http://www.uhns.nhs.uk) and the [Institute for Science and Technology in Medicine](http://www.keele.ac.uk/istm/). During the project I was supervised by Dr KP Lam and Mr David Collins.
