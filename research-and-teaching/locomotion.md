# The Locomotion Project
The Locomotion Project developed a profiler which detects parallel loops dynamically at runtime. This profiler will uses the [Graal compiler infrastructure](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/graal/) in order to register every read and write operation to/from memory and identifying potential dependancies.

The [dissertation PDF](pub/parallelism-detection.pdf) is available.
