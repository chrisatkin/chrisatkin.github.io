# The Locomotion Project
Under the Locomotion Project (which is my MSc dissertation), I will develop a profiler which will detect parallel loops dynamically at runtime. This profiler will use the [Graal compiler infrastructure](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/graal/) in order to register every read and write operation to/from memory and identifying potential dependancies.

**This project is still in its infancy. Check back regularly for updates!**
