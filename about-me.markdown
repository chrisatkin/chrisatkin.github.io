# About Me
Hello there!

I'm a Masters student at [The University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk), based in both the [School of Informatics](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk) and [Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre](http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk). Before I came to Edinburgh, I spent three years studying Computer Science in the [School of Computing and Mathematics](http://keele.ac.uk/scm) at the [University of Keele](http://keele.ac.uk).

My area of expertise is in computer systems, software engineering and high-performance computing; I spend most of my time these days thinking about parallelism detection and discovery. My MSc dissertation is investigating run-time analysis of hot-loops to automatically detect parallelism. While I was at Keele, I worked on [radiotherapy treatment planning](research/apex.html) and [low-cost approaches to gait analysis](research/gait-analysis.html).

Starting in September 2013 I will be undertaking an internship at [GuideSpark](http://guidespark.com) as part of the [Silicon Valley Internship Programme](http://www.siliconvalleyinternship.com). As with my [trip to Europe](http://europe.skyther.co.uk), I'm going to record my adventure on the internet in the form of a [blog](http://california.chrisatk.in/blog), amongst other things which are still go to happen.
