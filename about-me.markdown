# About Me
I'm a software engineer working at [GuideSpark](http://guidespark.com) in Menlo Park, California. I'm here as part of the [Silicon Valley Internship Programme](http://siliconvalleyinternship.com), Class of 2014. Before I came to Silicon Valley, I spent three years studying Computer Science at the [University of Keele](http://keele.ac.uk), [School of Computing and Mathematics](http://keele.ac.uk/scm) and one year studying Computer Science with a Systems and HPC specialism at the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk) [School of Informatics](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk) and [Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre](http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk).

My area of expertise is in the area of computer systems, software engineering and high-performance computing. As part of my [Masters dissertation](research-and-teaching/locomotion.html), I wrote a dynamic instrumentation toolkit for the JVM for detecting parallelism with minimal overhead.

If you're interested, you can see my [CV](cv.html) and [what I'm reading at Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/profiles/christopher-atkin-granville/).
