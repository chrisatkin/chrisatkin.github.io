# About Me

![This is me](assets/me-colour.jpg "Me")

I'm a computer scientist and software engineer currently at [GuideSpark](http://guidespark.com) in Menlo Park, California. Originally, I came here as part of the [Silicon Valley Internship Programme](http://siliconvalleyinternship.com), Class of 2014 but I've since graduated from SVIP. Most of the time I'm working as a full-stack engineer on our Rails application, but I also work on internal tools using C#.

A native of North Yorkshire, England, I spent three years studying computer science at the [School of Computing and Mathematics](http://www.keele.ac.uk/scm), [University of Keele](http://www.keele.ac.uk) where I attained my Bachelor's degree. After that, I earned a Master's degree jointly at [School of Informatics](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk) and [Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre](http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk) at the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk). 

Whilst at Edinburgh, my specialism was in Computer Systems, Software Engineering and High-Performance Computing. As part of my [Masters dissertation](research-and-teaching/locomotion.html), I wrote an instrumentation toolkit for the JVM for detecting parallelism at run-time with minimal overhead.

Having said that, I'm extremely comfortable working at all parts of the stack. At various points of my career I've worked on full-stack web development through image processing though to data analysis. I find that one of the best parts of having a formal computer science education is the ability to pick up new ideas and tools quickly.
