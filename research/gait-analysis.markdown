# Gait Analysis

I worked with the [Institute for Science and Technology in Medicine](http://keele.ac.uk/istm/) (ISTM) along with the Schools of [Computing and Mathematics](http://keele.ac.uk/scm) and [Health & Rehabilitation](http://keele.ac.uk/healthandrehabilitation/) for three months after I finished my undergraduate degree.

We investigated [low-cost approaches to gait analysis](pub/approaches.pdf).
